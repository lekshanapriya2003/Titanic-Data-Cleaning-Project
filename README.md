# 🚢 Titanic Data Cleaning Project
📌 Objective
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning. The goal is to handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numerical values, and remove outliers effectively.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

The dataset contains information on passengers such as age, fare, class, gender, and survival status.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Data preprocessing utilities

🧪 Steps Performed
1. 📥 Importing and Exploring the Dataset
Loaded the CSV file using pandas.read_csv()

Explored basic data types, null values, and summary statistics using .info() and .describe()

2. 🚫 Handling Missing Values
Age: Filled missing values with median

Embarked: Filled with mode

Cabin: Dropped due to high number of nulls

3. 🧠 Encoding Categorical Features
Applied Label Encoding on Sex

Applied One-Hot Encoding on Embarked

4. 📊 Feature Scaling
Used StandardScaler from sklearn to standardize numerical columns:

Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch

5. 🔍 Outlier Detection and Removal
Visualized outliers using boxplots

Removed them using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method

📈 Results
Successfully cleaned and preprocessed the dataset

Dataset is now ready for machine learning model building

🧠 Key Learnings
Importance of handling missing data correctly

Difference between label and one-hot encoding

Why scaling features matters in ML

How outliers impact model performance

❓ Common Interview Questions Covered
What are types of missing data?

How do you handle missing values?

Label Encoding vs One-Hot Encoding?

Normalization vs Standardization?

How to detect and treat outliers?

Why is preprocessing critical before model training?

🚀 Next Steps
Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Evaluate model performance with and without preprocessing
